# HandwrittenDigitsRecognitionAI
I created an AI model that goes through a training set of lots of handwritten digits and learns how to classify them as the respective digits. 
This was a school project showing the implementation of AI in real life.
For this program, you have to upload your handwritten digits onto it (maybe after drawing them in paint app on windows) 
The program will recognize it and classify it as a digit from 0-9 and will indicate the accuracy of its decision.
